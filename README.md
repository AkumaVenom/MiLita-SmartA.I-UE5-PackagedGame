Mi Lita is a cutting-edge simulation game powered by the latest advancements in AI and Unreal Engine 5. Players are NOT interacting with a pre-programmed NPC, They are conversing with Lita, the game's captivating star attraction, who possesses true conversational freedom powered by the latest in Chat AI.

Lita is the heart and soul of your experience. Using voice recognition, you can speak directly to her with your voice, and she’ll respond with her own voice in real time with her own thoughts, emotions, and actions inside the game world, thanks to her advanced AI.

Set in a sprawling cyberpunk slum metropolis where the night never ends, Neon City pulses with energy as music echoes from every corner, night clubs illuminate the streets, and towering skyscrapers cast a glowing haze over the urban jungle, As the city hums with life.

Mi Lita isn’t just about talking to a digital companion—it’s about exploring a world where your interactions matter. As you engage with Lita, She may learn from you, adapt to your choices, and make decisions of her own. The deeper you connect with Lita, the more complex and dynamic your journey through Neon City becomes. Whether you're diving into the city's dark secrets, or simply exploring the endless neon-lit streets and nightclubs, Mi Lita offers a new kind of storytelling, one where the lines between player and character blur, and every life like conversation could lead to a surprising new path.

In Mi Lita, you don't just play the game, You shape it, one conversation and action at a time. Are you ready to meet Lita and see where your choices take you in this living, breathing world?

The default A.I model is recommended to use "Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_S.gguf"

The model can be replaced in the packaged build of the game to any that you want to use, Just change the new model file name to what the current model file name is and it should work as long as its .gguf file format.
Note: don't expect every GGUF model to work but i have tested many and a lot work and some do not.

100% offline, NO internet needed to run it, it is completely local only.
The A.I Features high quality Kokoro TTS Voice and Speech recognition en-us, everything running 100% offline on your PC with privacy!

Features voice commands like "follow me" to get Lita to follow you and "stop following me" to get her to stop.

Mi Lita is a work in progress that is currently in the early alpha stage at the moment.
